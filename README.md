# Countries-of-the-World

Link to the Kaggle contributor that built this data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023

This repository holds a Python script that calls data from the Kaggle API, cleans and transforms it, performs some analysis on the data, and breaks the data frame up into smaller sets and writes those sets to csv.

The smaller sets are then loaded into a SQL database using pgAdmin 4 via a SQL script. As of now, some of the analyses include regression, PCA, and K-means clustering.

This work is far from complete, with thorough commentary/explanation, more modeling, more visualization, and hopefully more engineering/cloud integration elements to come.
